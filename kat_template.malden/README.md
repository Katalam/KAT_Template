## Getting started

To understand the code you have to start with this: [ACE Coding Guidelines](https://ace3mod.com/wiki/development/coding-guidelines.html) and continue here [Shedular and our Pratices](https://ace3mod.com/wiki/development/arma-3-scheduler-and-our-practices.html)
Every not CBA Macro is defined here: [Script Component](https://github.com/Katalam/templates/blob/master/kat_template.malden/script_component.hpp)
All Loadouts Macros are here: [Script Component](https://github.com/Katalam/templates/blob/master/kat_template.malden/functions/loadouts/script_component.hpp)

Every description.ext config class is defined in a extra file. The #include macros will combine it to one file but for better overview it is seperated.
This is a template for your own mission. So you have to delete everything you don't need.
Mission folders have to be as small as possible. Every sound and picture have to minimised in size and length.
For example the .psd and .png file for the unflip vehicle action don't need to be in your own mission. Or if you wanna play a german army mission, the unit insignias for the us army aren't needed.
